Minimal sbt 0.10.0 and scala 2.9.0 project

The sbt commands are available as `bin/sbt.sh` and `bin\sbt.bat`

The project has been configured with both the sbt-idea and the sbt-eclipse plugin. Please note that git is a prerequisite for the sbt-idea plugin since it hasn't got a published artifact yet.

To generate Eclipse files: `bin/sbt.sh eclipse`

To generate IntelliJ IDEA files `bin/sbt.sh gen-idea`
